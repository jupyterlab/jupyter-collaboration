Jupyter RTC Documentation
=========================

**Real Time Collaboration for Jupyter and beyond**

Jupyter RTC is the realtime collaboration foundation for Project Jupyter and follows the Jupyter [Community Guides](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/community/content-community.html).

```{note}
The Jupyter RTC project is still in the inception stage and is rapidly evolving in terms of design
and implementation. Use at your own risk. If you find any issues or have requirements, please report them 
on the [Issue Board](https://github.com/jupyterlab/rtc/issues).
```

We welcome you to [contribute](organisation/contribute) to this project.
